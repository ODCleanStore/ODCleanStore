	<h1>Label property</h1>
	
	<p>The properties specified on this page are treated by the Query Execution component as human readable labels of resources. These labels are loaded for all URI resources that appear in a query result and returned together with the result. Simply add new label property by using <input class="button" disabled="disabled" style="width: 130px;" value="Add a new property" /> and remove any by use of corresponding <input class="button delete" disabled="disabled" style="width: 45px;" value="Delete" />.</p>
	
	<p><em>Notice: The values are cached and their change may take some time to take effect.</em></p>
