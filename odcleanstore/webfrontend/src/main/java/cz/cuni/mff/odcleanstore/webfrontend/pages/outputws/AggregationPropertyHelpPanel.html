	<h1>Aggregation</h1>
	
	<p>Multivalue in this context specifies whether a property may or may not have more values at a time. This effects the way aggregate quality is calculated in responses to user queries over the webservice. </p>
	<p>Aggregation type specifies which method to use to resolve conflicts in result Data.</p>
	<p>Aggregation error strategy specifies a fallback behaviour in case that aggregation cannot take place due to data types incompatibilities with the aggregation method.</p>
	<p>There are three levels of configuration with increasing precedence:
        <ol>
            <li>Default configuration - can be edited in Global aggregation settings.</li>
            <li>Per-property configuration - can be edited in Aggregation settings for individual properties.</li>
            <li>User-provided configuration at query time.</li>
        </ol>
