	<h1>Aggregation</h1>
	
	<p>Multivalue in this context specifies whether a property may or may not have more values at a time. This effects the way conflicts are resolved in responses to user queries over the webservice.</p>
	<p>Aggregation type specifies which method to use to infer values in response.</p>
	<p>Aggregation error strategy specifies a fallback behaviour in case that aggregation cannot take place due to data types incompatibilities with the aggregation method.</p>
	<p>The configuration specifies one global behaviour and then it offers the user to override that behaviour for specific properties.</p>
