	<h1>DN rename template instance</h1>
	
	<p>Rename Rules are used to change predicates in RDF triples from <em>Source property</em> to <em>Target property</em>.</p>
	
	<p><em>Notice: Each filled in template generates an ordinary raw rule which can be further modified manually. Any change to the template instance will cause an update of the associated raw rule and all custom modifications be overwritten.</em></p>
