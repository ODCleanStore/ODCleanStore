	<h1>Ontology mapping</h1>
	
	<p>A benefit of storing ontologies in the database is a gain of ability to map properties from one ontology to properties from another with <em>owl:sameAs</em>, <em>owl:equivalentProperty</em>, <em>rdfs:subPropertyOf</em>, <em>rdfs:subClassOf</em> or a custom URI of any other property. This can be further used by Conflict Resolution component to produce more precise results. In this section a pair of ontologies needs to be selected to restrain to a specific set of properties. After submitting the pair of ontologies a new form is presented where individual properties can be mapped. After filling in URI's of source and target properties, selecting a relation type and submitting a mapping is created. From that point on it will be considered during conflict resolution.</p>
