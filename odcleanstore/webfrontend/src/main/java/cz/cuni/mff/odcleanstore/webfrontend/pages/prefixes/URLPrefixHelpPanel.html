	<h1>URL prefix</h1>
	
	<p>To avoid obligation of full manual URI expansion in transformer rules or queries it is possible to maintain set of global RDF prefixes that storage recognizes. These can be added with <input class="button" disabled="disabled" style="width: 110px;" value="Add a new prefix" /> button and removed by <input class="button delete" disabled="disabled" style="width: 45px;" value="Delete" /> button next to the desired target of removal.</p>
