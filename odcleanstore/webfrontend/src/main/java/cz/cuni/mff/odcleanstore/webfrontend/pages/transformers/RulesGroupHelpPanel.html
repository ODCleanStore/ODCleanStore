	<h1>Group of rules</h1>
	
	<p>As multiple rules are often ment to be applied together the user can group them and then operate the group as a whole.</p>
	
	<p>Each group is identified by its label and can (and should) come with a description of its semantical significance.</p>
	
	<p><em>Notice:  Each rule needs to belong to a group.</em></p>
