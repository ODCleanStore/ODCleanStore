	<h1>User account</h1>
	
	<p>The Administration Frontend verifies user privileges before providing access to different configurations and content. This section lists all registered accounts in a table with all the information (username, e-mail address, first and second name, roles assigned to the account). The administrator can assign roles and reset password from this overview and related editable pages. To edit the roles, simply use <input class="button" disabled="disabled" style="width: 40px;" value="Roles" /> button and for reseting the password use <input class="button" disabled="disabled" style="width: 95px;" value="New password" /> button which will prompt you for confimation and then generate a new password and send it via the e-mail address to the user in question if the confirmation is given.</p>
	
	<p>Any account can be irreversibly removed with <input class="button delete" disabled="disabled" style="width: 45px;" value="Delete" />.</p>
