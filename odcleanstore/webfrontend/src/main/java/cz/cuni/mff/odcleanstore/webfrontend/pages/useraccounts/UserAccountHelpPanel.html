	<h1>User account</h1>
	
	<p>The frontend verifies user privileges before providing access to different configurations and content. To be able to maintain user roles and permissions that are implied for individual users the Administration Frontend provides this section. All registered accounts will be displayed in a table with all the information (username, e-mail address, first and second name, roles assigned to the account). The administrator can assign roles and reset password from this overview and related editable pages. For editing the roles simply use <input class="button" disabled="disabled" style="width: 40px;" value="Roles" /> button and for reseting the password use <input class="button" disabled="disabled" style="width: 95px;" value="New password" /> button which will prompt you for confimation and then generate a new password and send it via the e-mail address to the user in question if the confirmation is given.</p>
	
	<p>Any account can be irreversibly removed with <input class="button delete" disabled="disabled" style="width: 45px;" value="Delete" />.</p>
