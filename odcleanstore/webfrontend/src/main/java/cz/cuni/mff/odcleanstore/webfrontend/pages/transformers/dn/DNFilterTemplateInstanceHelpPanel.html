	<h1>DN filter template instance</h1>
	
	<p>Filter Rules remove all triples where predicate matches <em>Property</em> and its stringified object matches (does not match) the provided pattern if value of <em>Keep</em> is <em>true</em> (<em>false</em>).</p>
	
	<p><em>Notice: Each filled in template generates an ordinary raw rule which can be further modified manually. Any change to the template instance will cause an update of the associated raw rule and all custom modifications be overwritten.</em></p>
