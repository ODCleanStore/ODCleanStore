	<h1>Ontology</h1>
	
	<p>Ontologies represented in RDF can be managed here. Mappings between ontologies (such as owl:sameAs links) can be defined among inserted ontologies.
	Also, rules for transformers can be automatically generated from ontologies.
	Ontologies can be used to produce common rules for Quality Assessment, Data Normalization transformers. To load one into the storage one can provide an explicit definition through a text field or by uploading a file containing a valid RDF/XML ontology definition. The process of rules generation will automatically take place upon ontology submission.</p>
