	<h1>Ontology</h1>
	
	<p>Ontologies can be used to produce common rules for Quality Assessment, Data Normalization transformers. To load one into the storage one can provide an explicit definition through a text field or by uploading a file containing a valid RDF/XML ontology definition. The process of rules generation will automatically take place upon ontology submission.</p>
