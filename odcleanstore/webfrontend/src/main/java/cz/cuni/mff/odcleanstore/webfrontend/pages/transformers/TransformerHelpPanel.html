	<h1>Transformer</h1>
	<wicket:link>
	    <p>Transformer is a component responsible for data refinement, cleaning, aggregation and other transformations and tasks applied to incoming or stored data.</p>
	    <p> There are several transformers that are included in ODCleanStore by default:
	    <ul>
		<li>Linker is a special implementation of a <a href="/cz/cuni/mff/odcleanstore/webfrontend/pages/pipelines/TransformersListPage.html"><span>Transformer</span></a>. The main purpose of this component is to interlink URIs which represent the same real-world entity by generating <em>owl:sameAs</em> links. It can be also used for creating other types of links between differently related URIs. Silk framework<sup><a href="#SilkFramework">1</a></sup> is used as the linking engine. Sets of linkage rules for the engine are written in Silk-LSL<sup><a href="#SilkLSL">2</a></sup> and stored in database.</li>
		<li>Quality Assessor is a special <a href="/cz/cuni/mff/odcleanstore/webfrontend/pages/pipelines/TransformersListPage.html"><span>Transformer</span></a> that assigns a score to each graph based on coefficients of different patterns present in the graph to reflect to what degree the data contained in it comply to a certain policy.</li>
		<li>Data Normalizer is a special type of <a href="/cz/cuni/mff/odcleanstore/webfrontend/pages/pipelines/TransformersListPage.html"><span>Transformer</span></a> aimed to be applied early in the whole data evaluation process to simplify work of other <a href="/cz/cuni/mff/odcleanstore/webfrontend/pages/pipelines/TransformersListPage.html"><span>Transformers</span></a>. Its main goal is to remove inconsistencies in forms the data is provided in.</li>
		</ul>
