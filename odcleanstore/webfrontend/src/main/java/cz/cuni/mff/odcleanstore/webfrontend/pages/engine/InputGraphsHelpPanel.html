	<h1>Graphs</h1>

	<p>The Graphs section captures the content of the graph database. The table of all graphs contains their identifiers in form of URI, states, pipelines that processed them, information about residence in clean or dirty database, and timestamp of the last update. Each of the graphs can be deleted (<input class="button delete" disabled="disabled" style="width: 45px;" value="Delete" />) or rerun (<input class="button" disabled="disabled" style="width: 40px;" value="Rerun" />) in which case it is processed by the pipeline in its current state. The URI is a link to output webservice and serves as detailed source of information about the graph.</p>
	
	<p>The detail page accessible through <input class="button" disabled="disabled" style="width: 40px;" value="Detail" /> button offers a download link for finished graphs.</p>
