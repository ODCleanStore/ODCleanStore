\chapter{Configuration Options}
Global configuration options for ODCleanStore are stored in configuration file \code{odcs.ini}. \todo{location, how it can be passed to Engine and webfrontend}

The configuration file is used both by ODCleanStore Engine and administration frontend. Configuration options are loaded only once when the Engine or administration frontend is started, therefore, it is necessary to restart the Engine or administration frontend web application for the changes to take effect.
\todo{how to restart engine and webfrontend}

List with a description of all configuration options follows:

\subsection*{General Configuration}
\begin{configlist}
	\item[clean\_jdbc\_connection\_string]
	  Connection string for JDBC access to the Virtuoso instance representing the clean database.
		\configdefault{jdbc:virtuoso://localhost:111}
	\item[clean\_jdbc\_username]
	  Username for JDBC access to the Virtuoso instance representing the clean database.
		\configdefault{dba}
	\item[clean\_jdbc\_password]
	  Password for JDBC access to the Virtuoso instance representing the clean database.
		\configdefault{dba}
	\item[clean\_sparql\_endpoint\_url]

	\item[dirty\_jdbc\_connection\_string]
	\item[dirty\_jdbc\_username]
	\item[dirty\_jdbc\_password]
	\item[dirty\_sparql\_endpoint\_url]
	\item[dirty\_update\_sparql\_endpoint\_url]
	\item[dirty\_update\_sparql\_endpoint\_username]
	\item[dirty\_update\_sparql\_endpoint\_password]
	
	\item[debug\_temp\_graph\_uri\_prefix]
		Prefix for names of temporary graphs created for rule debugging
		\configdefault{http://opendata.cz/infrastructure/odcleanstore/debug\_tmp/}
\end{configlist}

\subsection*{Input Webservice Configuration}

	\item[input\_ws.input\_dir\_path]
		Path to a temporary directory for data incoming to Input Webservice.
		\configdefault{input\_ws\_workdir}

	\todo{}
\end{configlist}

\subsection*{Output Webservice Configuration}
\begin{configlist}
		\item[query\_execution.max\_query\_result\_size]
			Maximum number of results allowed in each database query performed during a query execution. This option effectively affects the maximum number of results returned in response to a query through Ouptut Webservice to a multiple of this number (cca 3 times the value of this option).
			\configdefault{500}
		\item[query\_execution.result\_graph\_uri\_prefix]
			URI of the named graph where the result quads of a query are placed.
			\configdefault{http://opendata.cz/infrastructure/odcleanstore/query/results/}
\end{configlist}

\subsection*{Query Execution Configuration}
\begin{configlist}
	\item[conflict\_resolution.agree\_coefficient]
		Agree coefficient used in aggregated quality formula -- value $N$ means that agreement of $N+1$ sources with score 1 on the same value will increase the quality of that value to 1.
			\configdefault{4}
	\item[conflict\_resolution.score\_if\_unknown]
			Graph score used if none is given in the input of Conflict Resolution (e.g. is unknown).
			\configdefault{1}
	\item[conflict\_resolution.named\_graph\_score\_weight]
			Weight of the named graph score in aggregated quality calculation (see \linebreak \code{conflict\_resolution.publisher\_score\_weight})
			\configdefault{0.8}
	\item[conflict\_resolution.publisher\_score\_weight]
			Weight of the graph publisher's score in aggregated quality calculation (see \linebreak \code{conflict\_resolution.named\_graph\_score\_weight})
			\configdefault{0.2}
	\item[conflict\_resolution.max\_date\_difference]
			Defference between two dates when their distance is equal to MAX\_DISTANCE constant, given in seconds. When the difference of two dates is higher or equal to this value, in Conflict Resolution, they are considered to be totally different; when the difference is smaller, the difference coefficient is proportionally smaller.
			\configdefault{31622400} (366 days)
\end{configlist}

      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
