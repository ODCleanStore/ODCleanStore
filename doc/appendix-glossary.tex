\section*{Data \& Data Quality}
\begin{glossarylist}
	\item[Dirty (staging) database] Database where incoming data are stored until they are processed by a~processing pipeline (e.g. clean, linked to other data, etc.)
	\item[Clean database] Database where incoming data are stored after they are successfully processed by the respective processing pipeline; this database can be accessed using the Output Webservice
	\item[\code{Payload} graph] Named graph where the actual inserted data, given in the \code{payload} parameter of Input Webservice, are stored
	\item[\code{Provenance} graph] Named graph where additional provenance metadata, given in the \code{provenance} field of Input Web Service, are stored
	\item[Metadata graph] Named graph where other metadata about a \code{payload} graph (such as source, timestamp, license, etc.) are stored
	\item[Attached graph] Named graph attached to a \code{payload} graph by a transformer
	\item[Named graph score] Quality of a~single (\code{payload}) named graph estimated by the Quality Assesment component and stored in the database, expressed as a~number from interval [0,1]
	\item[Publisher score] Average score of named graphs from a~publisher
	\item[Aggregate quality] Quality of a~triple in the results calculated by the Conflict Resolution component during query time, expressed as a~number from interval [0,1]
\end{glossarylist}

\section*{Data processing}
\begin{glossarylist}
	\item[Pipeline] A configurable sequence of transformers that is used to process a named graph. The pipeline to process data sent to Input Webservice can be selected explicitly, or the default pipeline is used.
	\item[Transformer] A Java class which implements the \term{Transformer} interface that and is registered in ODCleanStore Administration Frontend by an administrator.
	\item[Transformer instance] Assignment of a \term{transformer} to a \term{pipeline}. A single transformer can be assigned to multiple pipelines (or even to a single pipeline multiple times), thus creating multiple transformer instances.
	\item[Rule] Some transformers included in ODCleanStore can be configured in Administration Frontend by rules. Rules are grouped together to \term{rule groups}.
	\item[Rule group] A group of transformer \term{rules}. Rule groups can be assigned to transformer instances.

	\item[ADM] Administrator
	\item[ONC] Ontology creator
	\item[PIC] Pipeline creator
	\item[SCR] Data producer (scraper)
	\item[USR] Data consumer
